# Calorie Counter

This project is a **Calorie Counter** web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to track their daily calorie intake by adding food entries for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks, as well as subtracting calories burned through exercise. The app calculates remaining calories based on a user-defined daily calorie budget.
